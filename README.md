# UFO Maze

UFO Maze is an agile obstacle based 3D game made with Unity. The goal is to go from Start to Finish point without touching obstacles as soon as possible.

It is the first video game I have ever created. It let me to experiment Unity in various aspects; from a developer view to a designer view.

I learned and practiced many Unity terms:
* The purpose of callbacks like Start() and Update() method.
* SerializeField to make a component available in the inspector.
* Input.GetAxis() method for the movement of player.
* Time.deltaTime to make the game frame rate independent.
* Time.time to show the time and modify the time of Dropper game objects.
* Cinemachine Virtual Camera made the camera control much better.
* Added Collision feedback and use it with OnCollisionEnter() method.
* GetComponent<>() to access and modify a game objectâ€™s components. 
* Caching Reference technique to made the most components easily accessible to avoid expensive calls.
* Tags to differentiate game objects.
* Prefab a game object to easily modify and add to the game.
